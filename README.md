# Tracemark

<br />

A Chrome extension that lets you draw over any webpage and export or copy the result as an image.

**[Install from the Chrome Web Store →](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tracemark/mgckpdklnjeklihpmplgcfnhncifikjd)**

Tracemark injects a full-page drawing overlay into the active tab. Annotate anything — articles, dashboards, designs — with a pencil, text, and framing tools, then export the annotated view as a PNG or copy it straight to your clipboard.

## Features

- **Draw over any page** — pencil, line, frame, text, eraser, and a color picker.
- **Edit as you go** — undo, redo, group, and delete your objects.
- **Capture in one click** — copy to clipboard or export as PNG. If drawings sit above or below the viewport, Tracemark stitches a full-page screenshot so they aren't cropped, without jumping your scroll position.
- **Toggle from the keyboard** — `Alt+Shift+D` (Option+Shift+D on Mac) opens or closes Tracemark on the current tab. Customize it at `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`. Press `Esc` to close while the overlay is open.
- **Stays out of your way** — draggable toolbar, `1`–`7` tool shortcuts, and Interact / Select modes.
- **Private by design** — runs only on the tab you activate, entirely in your browser.

## Getting Started

Requires [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) (see `packageManager` in `package.json`).

```bash
# install dependencies
pnpm install

# run in dev mode
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` launches a browser with the extension loaded and hot reload enabled.

## Build

```bash
# production build
pnpm build

# package as a distributable zip
pnpm zip
```

Build output lands in `.output/`.

## Scripts

| Script       | Description                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`   | Dev mode with hot reload                      |
| `pnpm build` | Production build                              |
| `pnpm zip`   | Package the extension as a zip                |
| `pnpm check` | Type-check the project (`wxt prepare && tsc`) |
| `pnpm lint`  | Run ESLint                                    |

## How It Works

Clicking the toolbar icon injects an overlay entrypoint into the active tab. The overlay mounts a React app inside a Shadow DOM container, isolating the extension's styles from the host page. A Fabric.js canvas sits on top of the page, and toolbar tools drive canvas state through React context providers. On export, the visible tab is captured (with the toolbar hidden). If annotations extend outside the viewport, Tracemark pins a still of the current view, scrolls and stitches slices underneath it, then restores your scroll position before lifting the still.
